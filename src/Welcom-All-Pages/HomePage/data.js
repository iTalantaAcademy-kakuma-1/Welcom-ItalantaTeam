      "It's great thanks to Microsoft ADC, Elewa and Windle International-Kenya for the revival of fading hopes and dreams. Before this program I was in vulnerable place and almost given up hopes on my tech career but my recruitment into the program has escalated my hope for the future and reignited my vision. And also a big thanks to my coaches, Noella and Alamin for their unconditional support throughout the course. I give my humble gratitude to everyone playing role in this program. It's all appreciated!.",
